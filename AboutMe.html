<p>My name is Aneesa and I am a travelholic and a foodie.  I am from cosmopolitan London and have an insatiable desire for traveling.  I have travelled over 30 countries and i am knocking off some big adventures off my bucket list.  Having spent time visiting different countries, i have an understanding of different cultures and traditions.  My love for cooking started when I have been traveling different parts of the world and trying different cuisine.  I strongly believe that travelling broadens the mind and I would like share my recipes with you.</p>  

<p>XOXO</p>
