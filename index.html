<p>Thank you for visiting my page.  Travelling has been a huge part of my life. I would like to share my experiences and adventures of my travels.</p> 
<p> I am also going to share my recipes with you and my passion for cooking. This collection of recipes represents just a taste of good food. </p>
<p>I love how moments can be captured on camera and how you can re-visit past adventures by going through photos.</p>
